# Overview

# Frameworks, Packages, and Dependencies

## Create React App

This project was initialised using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). Create React App is an exceptional tool for projects such as this given it's efficient deployment of an environment within the limited scope of the design.

## Jest

I have plans to further utilise [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) alongside the rest of the react testing suite in order to round off this project however it's is used sparingly in this project as the inital intention was simply to have this a practice project. My ambition is to create a test-driven project for my next undertaking as orienting some of my problems around a test-first structure within this scenario proved invaluable.

## Typescript

Transitioning from Javascript to (Typescript)[https://www.typescriptlang.org/] has completely altered my perspective on front-end programming. While in some cases it resulted in redundant code, the time saved during the debugging stage was worth it.

## Styled Components

I use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) throughout this build as I find the strcuture of styled components provide a easily-legible codebase while also being a lightweight addition to my dependencies.

## Material UI

As the components that convey the functionality of the maze and its solvers are well outside the scope of any component framework, the only use of a component framework in this context was to provide simple form components and rudimentary styling. As such I used a handful of the [MUI](https://mui.com/) library's components but could have ultimately utilised default browser components and simple CSS to achieve the same goal. MUI however does provide universally consistent components and is ultimately not too resource-heavy.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
