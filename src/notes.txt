At the top level we have 'the loop method'
    FN - while the win conditions aren't true
    FN - while the lose conditions aren't true
Below that we have the path Mutator
    Var - take the current node (last in path)
    FN - get it's children
    FN - mutate the path the include the children where necessary
    FN - run the child mutate
Below that we have the optional node Mutator
    This will take the current and future node
    edit these two accordingly.
